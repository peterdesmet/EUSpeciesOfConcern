The European Union has a [List of Invasive Alien Species of Union concern](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/invasivealien/list/index_en.htm). Information on the interactions of these species with other species in Europe will help understand the potential impacts of these species on biodiversity.
This repository mobilises data on species interations from published sources to the [Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI)](http://globalbioticinteractions.org) database. The species covered are primarily listed species, however, interacting species and other species mentioned interacting within the publications are also captured.

## Listed species currently covered
1. *Ailanthus altissima*
2. *Impatiens glandulifera*
